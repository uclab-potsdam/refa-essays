Johannes Voigt provided a further indication of the location in the church in 1824 in the ” Contributions to the history of the von Auerswalde family” (Beiträgen zur Geschichte der Familie von Auerswalde): “They were both buried in the church of Auerswald, where their portraits were later also found.” The provenance of the works can be deduced from the "),zr=n(_e,"A",{href:!0});var Lg=s(zr);cm=o(Lg,"label on the reverse"),Lg.forEach(r),fm=o(_e," on the donor’s portrait.
