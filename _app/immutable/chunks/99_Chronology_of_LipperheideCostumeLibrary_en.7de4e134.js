After the end of the war, problems of competence and ownership dominated in the museums, as well as storage problems resulting from the destroyed museum buildings.

Eight days later, on 12 April 1945, the American army also occupied the area not far from the Grasleben salt mine near Helmstedt and the Schönebeck salt mine on the Elbe near Magdeburg]. Germany’s occupation by the Allies naturally led to property difficulties and loss of control over the storage sites after the end of the war.[^In the course of the fighting, the museums in Prinz-Albrecht-Straße and Saarlandstraße (Stresemannstraße) were occupied by Russian troops on 1 May 1945 and on the following day (the surrender) also the Museum Island, i.e. the Kaiser-Friedrich-Museum, Pergamon, Neues Museum, Altes Museum and the Nationalgalerie. As the city was divided into four sectors, the museum buildings came under American, Soviet and British administration.
From 7 May 1945 onwards, deportations took place, including those of holdings from Prinz-Albrecht-Straße. They lasted until the first week of June, stopped briefly and began again in December 1945. The Kunstbibliothek was not affected by the removals, but the cellars and storerooms of the Museum Island were. No report on this has survived. In the further course of events, the museum buildings were divided up to the Western powers, in this case the American troops]. After the end of the war, problems of competence and ownership dominated in the museums, as well as storage problems resulting from the destroyed museum buildings.

Johannes Voigt provided a further indication of the location in the church in 1824 in the ” Contributions to the history of the von Auerswalde family” (Beiträgen zur Geschichte der Familie von Auerswalde): “They were both buried in the church of Auerswald, where their portraits were later also found.” The provenance of the works can be deduced from the "),Rr=n(_e,"A",{href:!0});var G1=s(Rr);_c=o(G1,"label on the reverse"),G1.forEach(r),Sc=o(_e," on the donor’s portrait.
