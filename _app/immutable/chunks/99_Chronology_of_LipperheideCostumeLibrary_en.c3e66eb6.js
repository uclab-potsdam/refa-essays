The inscription with the year 1566 probably refers to the event in the municipality of Auerswalde that was decisive for the foundation, as the copy of a letter from the local chronicler Ottwin Saupe to the descendants of the Dohnas states the dates 1585 for the donor’s portrait and 1586 for the portrait of the donor. The author also reports that the two portraits, which had previously been attached to the upper porch of the manorial Auerswald chapel, were taken down, packed and sent to the Dohna descendants at Plauthen Castle in early September 1850. Johannes Voigt provided a further indication of the location in the church in 1824 in the ” Contributions to the history of the von Auerswalde family” (Beiträgen zur Geschichte der Familie von Auerswalde): “They were both buried in the church of Auerswald, where their portraits were later also found.” The provenance of the works can be deduced from the "),Hr=a("a"),vm=i("label on the reverse"),ym=i(" on the donor’s portrait.
