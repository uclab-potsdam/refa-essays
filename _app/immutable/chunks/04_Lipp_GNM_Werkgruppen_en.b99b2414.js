Such pictorial cycles or individual scenes, in each of which one sense is singled out and interpreted as a symbol, were particularly popular.

For example, after 1587 Adam van Noort created the drawings for this "),Be=i("a"),oi=t("engraving"),ii=t(" in which the Five Senses are united on one sheet [^Allegory of the Five Senses, Adam van Noort (designer), Adriane Collaert (engraver), 1570-1618, copper engraving, 22 x 27.1 cm, Rijksmuseum (Amsterdam)].

Cornelis de Vos, Adriaen van Ostade, Jan Miense Molenaer, Barent Fabritius, Ambrosius Francken the Younger and Herman van Aldewereld created such pictorial cycles.[^Cf. Fünf Sinne in der Malerei 2016]
French still life painting of the 1620s and 1630s also integrated the theme of the Five Senses. Furthermore, the biblical story of the Prodigal Son was interwoven with that of the Five Senses from the end of the 16th century, especially in the Netherlands. Scenes in inns with people playing music, drinking and smoking illustrate this. Painters such as Simon de Vos and David Teniers the Younger spread this pictorial theme. Another group of representations are the already mentioned narrative representations in the form of genre scenes: Until the 19th century, this type of painting, represented by artists such as Philip van Dijk, Luca Giordano, Gerard de Lairesse, Jacob Duck or Michiel Sweerts, was popular.

Ridikül! 2003, pp. 33-35. Reading fashion caricatures must take into account the temporal context of their creation as well as the audience, and speculative interpretations should be compared with surviving written sources].
As both entertaining and serious contemporary documents, they not only provide information about the fashionable styles of the time, but also about social perceptions in relation to them. Fashion caricatures broaden our knowledge of how fashion was received, how it was evaluated by contemporaries, their attitude to ideals of beauty, the contemporary interpretation of political connotations, for example, and the fashion clientele itself. In addition, they also show a view towards contemporaries dressed according to the latest fashion, which varies from nation to nation.

Fünf Sinne in der Malerei 2016]
French still life painting of the 1620s and 1630s also integrated the theme of the Five Senses. Furthermore, the biblical story of the Prodigal Son was interwoven with that of the Five Senses from the end of the 16th century, especially in the Netherlands. Scenes in inns with people playing music, drinking and smoking illustrate this. Painters such as Simon de Vos and David Teniers the Younger spread this pictorial theme. Another group of representations are the already mentioned narrative representations in the form of genre scenes: Until the 19th century, this type of painting, represented by artists such as Philip van Dijk, Luca Giordano, Gerard de Lairesse, Jacob Duck or Michiel Sweerts, was popular.

Fashion caricatures broaden our knowledge of how fashion was received, how it was evaluated by contemporaries, their attitude to ideals of beauty, the contemporary interpretation of political connotations, for example, and the fashion clientele itself.

A ‘gusset’ (dt.: Zwickel) extending to the waist was introduced in the back. This consisted of at least three flaps folded open, which were removed from the shoulder of the doublet.

The lacing brought the edges of the waist pieces together at the bottom and pressed them outwards. This effect was intensified when the doublet was buttoned up. This lent the doublet its pointed shape and made it look more like a cuirass than its predecessors. Eyelet holes are set into the waistband of the doublet; these were purely decorative.

Anne, Queen of England, illustrating the symbolic significance of dress and jewellery. Interchangeable portraits are a sub-genre of miniature paintings and were a popular subject in the courtly context of the 17th century. A popular motif since the 16th century were depictions of the five senses gustus, odoratus, visus, auditus and tactus with accompanying attributes. Fashion caricatures and moral mockeries are amusing and informing. Their informational content though differs from other forms of pictorial representation. Finally, early vests, an 18th-century silk dress and waistcoats and frocks in 18th-century men's fashion are presented in their three-dimensional form and in painted reality.",cover:"https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/refa-catalog/files/large/0482e947a7bb05f182159cf6a8f8e46efacc6a02.jpg"};class Sf extends Cf{constructor(X){super(),Pf(this,X,null,xf,jf,{})}}export{Sf as default,Ff as metadata};
