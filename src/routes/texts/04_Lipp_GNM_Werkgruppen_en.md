# Allegory of the Five Senses
Like other cycles - for example the Four Continents or the Deadly Sins - the Five Senses became a popular allegorical subject in the 16th century, spreading mainly through Dutch prints. The five senses gustus, odoratus, visus, auditus and tactus are accompanied by animal symbols or attributes. The sense *Visus* is accompanied by the animals eagle, lynx, cat or owl or the attributes telescope, magnifying glass, spectacles or [mirror](item/10538). The sense of hearing (Auditus) is accompanied by a boar, a mole or deer or a musical instrument, usually the lute. The sense of smell (Oderatus) has as companion either a vulture or dog or as an attribute a [flower](item/10300), usually the [carnation](item/45235). Taste (Gustus), as in this example *[The Taste](item/538)*, is accompanied by a [monkey](item/10475) or represented with fruits, a fruit basket or with [wine glass](item/10431). As fifth sense is considered to be the sense of touch (tactus), which is accompanied either by a spider, a turtle, a scorpion or a [bird](item/10587) with a symbolic content, such as an [ornamental bird](item/583) pecking into the hand, or by a harp.
 
The Five Senses Cycle by [Cornelis Cort](item/45189), based on designs by Frans Floris (1561), led the way in its dissemination. In it, he combined two concepts that were already common in the Middle Ages: Female personifications of the senses endowed with attributes (significant objects) are accompanied by [symbolising sense-gifted animals](item/10587). Such pictorial cycles or individual scenes, in each of which one sense is singled out and interpreted as a symbol, were particularly popular. Similarly, allegorical representations of the five senses were created from the end of the 16th century onwards. For example, after 1587 Adam van Noort created the drawings for this [engraving](item/42994) in which the Five Senses are united on one sheet [^Allegory of the Five Senses, Adam van Noort (designer), Adriane Collaert (engraver), 1570-1618, copper engraving, 22 x 27.1 cm, Rijksmuseum (Amsterdam)]. A new realistic conception of the subject can also be discerned in an engraving executed by [Adriane Collaert](item/42994), with which the change from the original allegory to a bourgeois social image begins. Abraham Govaerts and Ambrosius Francken II (?) placed the [Allegory of the Five Senses](item/45736) from 1624 in a landscape setting.[^Landscape with the Allegory of the Five Senses, Abraham Govaerts, Ambrosius Francken II (?), 1624, Kunstpalast, D端sseldorf, Inv.-No. M 38]

The diversity of allegorical representations of the five senses, especially in Flemish and Dutch painting in the 17th century, produced large-scale allegories and small cabinet paintings. Cornelis de Vos, Adriaen van Ostade, Jan Miense Molenaer, Barent Fabritius, Ambrosius Francken the Younger and Herman van Aldewereld created such pictorial cycles.[^Cf. F端nf Sinne in der Malerei 2016]
French still life painting of the 1620s and 1630s also integrated the theme of the Five Senses. Furthermore, the biblical story of the Prodigal Son was interwoven with that of the Five Senses from the end of the 16th century, especially in the Netherlands. Scenes in inns with people playing music, drinking and smoking illustrate this. Painters such as Simon de Vos and David Teniers the Younger spread this pictorial theme. Another group of representations are the already mentioned narrative representations in the form of genre scenes: Until the 19th century, this type of painting, represented by artists such as Philip van Dijk, Luca Giordano, Gerard de Lairesse, Jacob Duck or Michiel Sweerts, was popular.
The present painting from the Lipperheide Collection, which originated in Baden-W端rttemberg, combines the representation of the Five Senses with a family portrait.
